1.  Introduction

   Initial focus on the transition to use of post-quantum algorithms in
   protocols has largely been on confidentiality, given the potential
   risk of store and decrypt attacks, where data encrypted today using
   traditional algorithms could be decrypted in the future by an
   attacker with a Cryptographically-Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC).
   While traditional authentication is only at risk once a CRQC exists,
   it is important to consider the transition to post-quantum
   authentication before this point.  This is particularly relevant for
   systems where algorithm turn-over is complex or takes a long time
   (e.g., long-lived systems with hardware roots of trust), or where
   future checks on past authenticity play a role (e.g., digital
   signatures on legal documents).

   One approach to design quantum-resistant protocols, particularly
   during the transition period from traditional to post-quantum
   algorithms, is incorporating Hybrid/Composite signatures schemes,
   which combine both traditional and post-quantum (or more generally
   next-generation) algorithms in one cryptographic scheme.
   Hybridization has been looked at for key encapsulation [HYBRIDKEM],
   and in an initial sense for digital signatures [HYBRIDSIG].  Compared
   to key encapsulation, hybridization of digital signatures, where the
   verification tag may be expected to attest to both standard and post-
   quantum components, is subtler to design and implement due to the
   potential separability of the composite signatures and the risk of
   downgrade/stripping attacks.  There are also a range of requirements
   and properties that may be required from dual signatures, not all of
   which can be achieved at once.

   This document focuses on explaining advantages and disadvantages of
   different hybrid signature scheme designs and different security
   goals for them.  It is intended as a resource for designers and
   implementers of hybrid signature schemes to help them decide what
   properties they do and do not require from their scheme.  It
   intentionally does not propose concrete hybrid signature combiners or
   instantiations thereof.

1.1.  Revision history

      *RFC Editor's Note:* Please remove this section prior to
      publication of a final version of this document.

   *  00: Initial version.

1.2.  Terminology

   We follow existing Internet drafts on hybrid terminology
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology] and hybrid key encapsulation
   mechanisms (KEM) [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design] to enable settling on a
   consistent language.  We will make clear when this is not possible.
   In particular, we follow the definition of 'post-quantum algorithm',
   'traditional algorithms', and 'combiner'.  Moreover, we use the
   definition of 'certificate' to mean 'public-key certificate' as
   defined in [RFC4949].

   *  Signature scheme: A signature scheme is defined via the following
      three algorithms:

      -  KeyGen() -> (pk, sk): A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
         which generates a public verifying key pk and a secret signing
         key sk.

      -  Sign(sk, m) -> (sig): A probabilistic signature generation,
         which takes as input a secret signing key sk and a message m,
         and outputs a signature sig.

      -  Verify(pk, sig, m) -> b: A verification algorithm, which takes
         as input a public verifying key pk, a signature sig and a
         message m, and outputs a bit b indicating accept ($b=1$) or
         reject ($b=0$) of the signature for message m.

   *  Hybrid signature scheme: Following
      [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology], we define a hybrid
      signature scheme to be "a multi-algorithm digital signature scheme
      made up of two or more component digital signature algorithms
      ...".  We require that the security of the component schemes is
      based on the hardness of different cryptographic assumptions.  In
      contrast to [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology], we will use
      the more general term 'hybrid signature scheme' instead of
      requiring one post-quantum and one traditional algorithm (i.e.,
      PQ/T hybrid signature schemes) to allow also the combination of
      several post-quantum algorithms.  The term 'composite' scheme is
      often used as a synonym for 'hybrid scheme'.  This is different
      from [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology] where the term is
      used at the protocol level.

   *  Hybrid signature: A hybrid signature is the output of the hybrid
      signature scheme's signature generation.  As synonyms we might use
      'composite signature' or 'dual signature'.  For example, NIST
      define a dual signature as "two or more signatures on a common
      message" [NIST_PQC_FAQ].

   *  Component (signature) scheme: Component signature schemes are the
      cryptographic algorithms contributing to the hybrid signature
      scheme.  This has a similar purpose as in
      [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology].  In this draft, we will
      use 'ingredient signature scheme' as a synonym.

   *  Next-generation algorithms: Similarly to the case of hybrid KEMs
      [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], hybrid signatures are mostly
      motiviated as preparation for the post-quantum migration.
      Following [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], we opt to use the more
      generic term "next-generation" and "traditional" algorithm instead
      of "post-quantum" and "classical" algorithms.

   *  Artifact: An artifact is evidence of the sender's intent to
      hybridize a signature that remains even if a component algorithm
      tag is removed.  Artifacts can be e.g., at the algorithmic level
      (e.g., within the digital signature), or at the protocol level
      (e.g., within the certificate), or on the system policy level
      (e.g., within the message).  Artifacts should be easily
      identifiable by the receiver in the case of signature stripping.

1.3.  Motivation for use of hybrid signature schemes

   Before diving into the design goals for hybrid digital signatures, it
   is worth taking a look at why hybrid digital signatures are desirable
   for some applications.  As many of the arguments hold in general for
   hybrid algorithms, we again refer to [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design]
   that summarizes these well.  In addition, we explicate the motivation
   for hybrid signatures here.

1.3.1.  *Complexity*

   Next-generation algorithms and their underlying hardness assumptions
   are often more complex than traditional algorithms and as such carry
   a higher risk of implementation mistakes and revision of parameters
   compared to traditional algorithms, such as RSA.  RSA is a relatively
   simple algorithm to understand and explain, yet during its existence
   and use there have been multiple attacks and refinements, such as
   adding requirements to how padding and keys are chosen, and
   implementation issues such as cross-protocol attacks.  Thus, even in
   a relatively simple algorithm subtleties and caveats on
   implementation and use can arise over time.  Given the complexity of
   next generation algorithms, the chance of such discoveries and
   caveats needs to be taken into account.

   Of note, next generation algorithms have been heavily vetted.  Thus,
   if and when further information on caveats and implementation issues
   come to light, it is less likely that a "break" will be catastrophic.
   Instead, such vulnerabilities and issues may represent a weakening of
   security - which may in turn be offset if a hybrid approach has been
   used.  The complexity of next-generation algorithms needs to be
   balanced against the fact that hybridization itself adds more
   complexity to a protocol and introduces the risk of implementation
   mistakes in the hybridization process.

   One example of a next generation algorithm is the signature scheme
   ML-DSA (a.k.a.  Kyber-Dilithium) that has been selected for
   standardization by NIST.  While the scheme follows the know Fiat-
   Shamir transform to construct the signature scheme, it also relies on
   rejection sampling that is known to give cache side channel
   information (not necessarily leading to a known attack though).
   Furthermore, recent attacks again some next-generation signature
   schemes such as MULTI-VARIATE schemes might call into question the
   asymptotic and concrete security for conservative adopters and
   therefore might hinder adoption.

1.3.2.  *Time*

   The need to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms now while
   simultaneously being aware of potential, hidden subtleties in their
   resistance to standard attacks drives transition designs towards
   hybridization.  Mosca’s equation [MOSCA] very simply illustrates the
   risk of post-quantum transition delay: $l + d > q$, where l is the
   information life-span, d is the time for system transition to post-
   quantum algorithms, and q is the time before a quantum computer is
   ready to execute cryptanalysis.  As opposed to key exchange and KEMs,
   it may not be obvious why there is urgency for an adoption of next-
   generation signatures; namely, while encryption is subject to store-
   now-decrypt-later attacks, there may not seem to be a parallel notion
   for authenticity, i.e., 'store-now-modify-later attacks'.

   However, in larger systems, including national systems, space
   systems, large healthcare support systems, and critical
   infrastructure, where acquisition and procurement time can be
   measured in years and algorithm replacement may be difficult or even
   practically impossible, this equation can have drastic implications.
   In such systems, algorithm turn-over can be complex and difficult and
   can take considerable time (such as in long-lived systems with
   hardware deployment), meaning that an algorithm may be committed to
   long-term, with no option for replacement.  Long-term committment
   creates further urgency for immediate next-generation algorithm
   selection.  Additionally, for some sectors future checks on past
   authenticity plays a role (e.g., many legal, financial, auditing, and
   governmental systems).  The 'store-now-modify-later' analogy would
   present challenges in such sectors, where future analysis of past
   authentication may be more critical than in e.g., internet connection
   use cases.  As such there is an eagerness to use next-generation
   signatures algorithms for some applications.

1.4.  Goals

   There are various security goals that can be achieved through
   hybridization.  The following provides a summary of these goals,
   while also noting where security goals are in conflict, i.e., that
   achievement of one goal precludes another, such as backwards
   compatibility.

1.4.1.  *Unforgeability*

   One goal is security of hybrid signature schemes, in particular that
   EUF-CMA security is maintained as long as at least one of the
   ingredient schemes is EUF-CMA secure.  There might be, however, other
   goals in competition with this one, such as backward-compatibility,
   where the EUF-CMA seucurity of the hybrid signature relies solely on
   the security of one of the ingredient schemes instead of relying on
   both.

1.4.2.  *Proof Composability*

   Under proof composability, the ingredient algorithms are combined in
   such a way that it is possible to prove a security reduction from the
   security properties of hybrid signature scheme to the properties of
   the respective ingredient signature schemes and, potentially, other
   building blocks such as hash functions, KDF, etc.  Otherwise an
   entirely new proof of security is required, and there is a lack of
   assurance that the combination builds on the standardization
   processes and analysis performed to date on ingredient algorithms.
   The resulting hybrid signature would be, in effect, an entirely new
   algorithm of its own.  The more the ingredient signature schemes are
   entangled, the more likely it is that an entirely new proof is
   required, thus not meeting proof composability.

1.4.3.  *Weak Non-Separability*

   Non-Separability was one of the earliest properties of hybrid digital
   signatures to be discussed [HYBRIDSIG].  It was defined as the
   guarantee that an adversary cannot simply “remove” one of the
   ingredient signatures without evidence left behind.  For example
   there are artifacts that a carefully designed verifier may be able to
   identify, or that are identifiable in later audits.  This was later
   termed Weak Non-Separability (WNS) [HYBRIDSIGDESIGN].  Note that WNS
   does not restrict an adversary from potentially creating a valid
   ingredient digital signatures from a hybrid one (a signature
   stripping attack), but rather implies that such a digital signature
   will contain artifacts of the separation.  Thus authentication is not
   simply provided by the sender to the receiver through correct
   verification of the digital signature(s), but potentially through
   further investigation on the receiver side that may extend well
   beyond traditional signature verification behavior.  For instance,
   this can intuitively be seen in cases of a message containing a
   context note on hybrid authentication, that is then signed by all
   ingredient algorithms/the hybrid signature scheme.  If an adversary
   removes one ingredient signature but not the other, then artifacts in
   the message itself point to the possible existence of hybrid
   signature such as a label stating “this message must be hybrid
   signed”. This might be a counter measure against stripping attacks if
   the verifier expects a hybrid signature scheme to ensure this
   property.  However, it places the responsibility of signature
   validity not only on the correct format of the message, as in a
   traditional signature security guarantee, but the precise content
   thereof.

1.4.4.  *Strong Non-Separability*

   Strong Non-Separability (SNS) is a stronger notion of WNS, introduced
   in [HYBRIDSIGDESIGN].  SNS guarantees that an adversary cannot take
   as input a hybrid signature (and message) and output a valid
   ingredient signature (and potentially different message) that will
   verify correctly.  In other words, separation of the hybrid signature
   into component signatures implies that the component signature will
   fail verification (of the component signature scheme) entirely.
   Therefore, authentication is provided by the sender to the receiver
   through correct verification of the digital signature(s), as in
   traditional signature security experiments.  It is not dependent on
   other components, such as message content checking, or protocol level
   aspects, such as public key provenance.  As an illustrative example
   distinguishing WNS from SNS, consider the case of ingredient
   algorithms $\Sigma_1.Sign$ and $\Sigma_2.Sign$ where the hybrid
   signature is computed as a concatenation $(sig_1, sig_2)$, where
   $sig_1 = \Sigma_1.Sign(hybridAlgID,m)$ and $sig_2 =
   \Sigma_2.Sign(hybridAlgID,m)$.  In this case, separation and delivery
   of a new message $m^* = (hybridAlgID,m)$ along with signature $sig_1$
   and $\Sigma_1.pk$ could allow for correct verification and the hybrid
   artifact is embedded in the message instead of the signature
   (identifiable through further investigation but the signature
   verification itself would not fail).  Thus, this case shows WNS
   (assuming the verification algorithm is defined accordingly) but not
   SNS.

   Some work [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs] has looked at reliance on
   the public key certificate chains to explicitly define hybrid use of
   the public key.  Namely, that $\Sigma_1.pk$ cannot be used without
   $\Sigma_2.pk$. This implies pushing the hybrid artifacts into the
   protocol and system level and a dependency on the security of other
   verification algorithms (namely those in the certificate chain).
   This further requires that security analysis of a hybrid digital
   signature requires analysis of the key provenance, i.e., not simply
   that a valid public key is used but how it hybridization and hybrid
   artifacts have been managed throughout the entire chain.  External
   dependencies such as this may imply hybrid artifacts lie outside the
   scope of the signature algorithm itself.  SNS may potentially be
   achieveable based on dependencies at the system level.

1.4.5.  *Backwards/Forwards Compatibility*

   Backwards compatibility refers to the property where a hybrid
   algorithm may also be used for legacy receivers that may take a
   hybrid signature and verify it as being valid using only the
   verification algorithm of one component scheme (e.g., the
   verification algorithm of the traditional signature scheme used in
   the hybrid scheme), potentially ignoring the next-generation
   signature entirely.  This provides an option to transition various
   sender system attributes to next-generation algorithms while still
   supporting select legacy receivers.  Notably, this is a verification
   property; the sender has provided a hybrid digital signature, but the
   verifier is allowed, due to internal restrictions and/or
   implementation, to only verify one component signature.  Backwards
   compatibility may be further decomposed to subcategories where
   ingredient key provenance is either separate or hybrid so as to
   support implementations that cannot recognize (and/or process) hybrid
   signatures.

   Forwards compatibility has also been a consideration in hybrid
   proposals [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth].  Forward
   compatibility assumes that hybrid signature schemes will be used for
   some time, but that eventually all systems will transition to use
   only one (particularly, only one next-generation) algorithm.  As this
   is very similar to backwards compatibility, it also may imply
   separability of a hybrid algorithm; however, it could also simply
   imply capability to support separate ingredient signatures.  Thus the
   key distinction between backwards and forwards compatibility is that
   backwards compatibility may be needed for legacy systems that cannot
   use and/or process hybrid or next-generation signatures, whereas in
   forwards compatibility the system has those capabilities and can
   choose what to support (e.g., for efficiency reasons).

   As noted in [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], ideally, forward/backward
   compatibility is achieved using redundant information as little as
   possible.

1.4.6.  *Simultaneous Verification*

   Simultaneous Verification (SV) builds on SNS and was first introduced
   in [HYBRIDSIGDESIGN].  SV requires that not only are all ingredient
   signatures needed to achieve a successful verification present in the
   hybrid signature, but also that verification of both component
   algorithms occurs simultaneously.  Namely, "missing" information
   needs to be computed by the verifier so they cannot “quit” the
   verification process before both component signatures are verified.
   SV mimics traditional digital signatures guarantees, essentially
   ensuring that the hybrid digital signature behaves as a single
   algorithm vs. two separate component stages.  Alternatively phrased,
   under an SV guarantee it is not possible for an unerring verifier to
   initiate termination of the hybrid verification upon successful
   verification of one component algorithm without also knowing if the
   other component succeeded or failed.

1.4.7.  *Hybrid Generality*

   Hybrid generality means that a general signature combiner is defined,
   based on inherent and common structures of component digital
   signatures "categories."  For instance, since multiple signature
   schemes use a Fiat-Shamir Transform, a hybrid scheme based on the
   transform can be made that is generalizable to all such signatures.
   Such generality can also result in simplified constructions where as
   more tailored hybrid variants might be more efficient in terms of
   sizes and performance.

1.4.8.  *High performance*

   Similarly to performance goals noted for hybridization of other
   cryptographic components [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design] hybrid
   signature constructions are expected to be as performant as possible.
   For most hybrid signatures this means that the computation time
   should only minimally exceed the sum of the component signature
   computation time.  It is noted that performance of any variety may
   come at the cost of other properties, such as hybrid generality.

1.4.9.  *High space efficiency*

   Similarly to space considerations in [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design],
   hybrid signature constructions are expected to be as space performant
   as possible.  This includes messages (as they might increase if
   artifacts are used), public keys, and the hybrid signature.  For the
   hybrid signature, size should no more than minimally exceed the
   signature size of the two component signatures.  In some cases, it
   may be possible for a hybrid signature to even be smaller than two
   component signatures.

1.4.10.  *Minimal duplicate information*

   Similarly to [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], duplicated information
   should be avoided when possible.  This might concern repeated
   information in hybrid certificates or in the communication of
   component certificates in additional to hybrid certificates (for
   example to acheive backwards/forwards-comptability), or sending
   multiple public keys or signatures of the same component algorithm.

2.  Non-separability spectrum

   Non-separability is not a singular definition but rather is a scale,
   representing degrees of separability hardness, visualized in
   Figure 1.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**No Non-Separability**
| no artifacts exist
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Weak Non-Separability**
| artifacts exist in the message, signature, system, application, or protocol
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Strong Non-Separability**
| artifacts exist in hybrid signature
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Strong Non-Separability w/ Simultaneous Verification**
| artifacts exist in hybrid signature and verification or failure of both
| components occurs simultaneously
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

  Figure 1: Spectrum of non-separability from weakest to strongest.

   At one end of the spectrum are schemes in which one of the ingredient
   signatures can be stripped away with the verifier not being able to
   detect the change during verification.An example of this includes
   simple concatenation of signatures without any artifacts used.
   Nested signatures (where a message is signed by one component
   algorithm and then the message-signature combination is signed by the
   second component algorithm) may also fall into this category,
   dependent on whether the inner or outer signature is stripped off
   without any artifacts remaining.

   Next on the spectrum are weakly non-separable signatures.  Under Weak
   Non-Separability, if one of the composite signatures of a hybrid is
   removed artifacts of the hybrid will remain (in the message,
   signature, or at the protocol level, etc.).  This may enable the
   verifier to detect if a component signature is stripped away from a
   hybrid signature, but that detectability depends highly on the type
   of artifact and permissions.  For instance, if a message contains a
   label artifact "This message must be signed with a hybrid signature"
   then the system must be allowed to analyze the message components for
   possible artifacts.  Whether a hybrid signature offers (Weak/Strong)
   Non-Separability might also depend on the implementation and policy
   of the protocol or application the hybrid signature is used in on the
   verifier side.  Such policies may be further ambiguous to the sender,
   meaning that the type of authenticity offered to the receiver is
   unclear.  In another example, under nested signatures the verifier
   could be tricked into interpreting a new message as the message/inner
   signature combination and verify only the outer signature.  In this
   case, the inner signature-tag is an artifact.

   Third on the scale is the Strong Non-Separability notion, in which
   separability detection is dependent on artifacts in the signature
   itself.  Unlike in Weak Non-Separability, where artifacts may be in
   the actual message, the certificate, or in other non-signature
   components, this notion more closely ties to traditional algorithm
   security notions (such as EUF-CMA) where security is dependent on the
   internal construct of the signature algorithm and its verification.
   In this type, the verifier is enabled to detect artifacts on an
   algorithmic level during verification.  For example, the signature
   itself encodes the information that a hybrid signature scheme is
   used.  Examples of this type may be found in [HYBRIDSIGDESIGN].

   For schemes achieving the most demanding security notions, i.e.,
   Strong Non-Separability with Simultaneous Verification, verification
   succeeds not only when both of the component signatures are present
   but also only when the verifier has verified both signatures.
   Moreover, no information is leaked to the receiver during the
   verification process on the possibile validity/invalidity of the
   component signatures until both verify.  This construct most closely
   mirrors traditional digital signatures where, assuming that the
   verifier does verify a signature at all, the result is either a
   positive verification of a the full signature or a failure if the
   signature is not valid.  For hybrid signatures, a full signature
   implies the hybridization of both component algorithms, and therefore
   the strongest non-separability notion enforces an all-or-nothing
   approach to verification.  Examples of algorithms providing this type
   of security can be found in [HYBRIDSIGDESIGN].

3.  Artifacts

   Hybridization benefits from the presence of artifacts as evidence of
   the sender's intent to decrease the risk of successful stripping
   attacks.  This, however, depends strongly on where such evidence
   resides (e.g., in the message, the signature, or somewhere on the
   protocol level instead of the algorithmic level).  Even commonly
   discussed hybrid approaches, such as concatenation, are not
   inherently tied to one type of security (e.g., WNS or SNS).  This can
   lead to ambiguities when comparing different approaches and
   assumptions about approach security or lack thereof.  Thus in this
   section we cover artifact locations and also walk through a high-
   level comparison of a few hybrid approach categories to show how
   artifact location can differ within a given approach.  Artifact
   location is tied to non-separability notions above; thus the
   selection of a given security guarantee and general hybrid approach
   must also include finer grained selection of artifact placement.

3.1.  Artifact locations

   There are a variety of artifact locations possible, ranging from
   within the message to the signature algorithm to the protocol level
   and even into policy, as shown in Table 1.  For example, one artifact
   location could be in the message-to-be-signed, e.g., containing a
   label artifact.  Depending on the hybrid type, this might be stripped
   away though.  For example, a quantum attacker could strip away the
   quantum-secure signature of a concatenated dual signature, and (being
   able to forge, e.g., ECDSA signatures) remove the label artifact from
   the message as well.  So, for many applications and threat models,
   adding an artificat in the message might not prevent stripping
   attacks.  Another artifact location could be in the public key
   certificates as described in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs].  In
   still yet another case, artifacts may be present through the fused
   hybrid method, thus making them part of the signature at the
   algorithmic level.

   Eventual security analysis may be a consideration in choosing between
   levels.  For example, if the security of the hybrid scheme is
   dependent on system policy, then cryptographic analysis must
   necessarily be reliant on specific policies and it may not be
   possible to describe a scheme's security in a standalone sense.

3.2.  Artifact Location Comparison Example

   Here we provide a high-level example of how artifacts can appear in
   different locations even within a single, common approach.  We look
   at the following categories of approaches: concatenation, nesting,
   and fusion.  This is to illustrate that nominally a given approach
   does not inherently imply a specific non-separability notion and that
   there are subtleties to the selection decision, since hybrid
   artifacts are related to non-separability guarantees.  Additionally,
   this comparison highlights how artifacts placement can be identical
   in two nominally different hybrid approaches.

   We briefly summarize the hybrid approach categories (concatenation,
   nesting, and fusion) for clarity in description, before showing how
   each one may have artifacts in different locations in Table 2.

   *  Concatenation: variants of hybridization where, for component
      algorithms $\Sigma_1.Sign$ and $\Sigma_2.Sign$, the hybrid
      signature is calculated as a concatenation $(sig_1, sig_2)$ such
      that $sig_1 = \Sigma_1.Sign(hybridAlgID,m)$ and $sig_2 =
      \Sigma_2.Sign(hybridAlgID,m)$.

   *  Nesting: variants of hybridization where for component algorithms
      Sigma_1.Sign and Sigma_2.Sign, the hybrid signature is calculated
      in a layered approach as (sig_1, sig_2) such that, e.g., sig_1 =
      Sigma_1.Sign(hybridAlgID, m) and sig_2 = Sigma_2.Sign(hybridAlgID,
      (m, sig_1)).

   *  Fused hybrid: variants of hybridization where for component
      algorithms Sigma_1.Sign and Sigma_2.Sign, the hybrid signature is
      calculated with entanglement to produce a single hybrid signature
      sig_h without clear component constructs.

           Table 2: Artifact locations depending on the hybrid
                              signature type

   As can be seen, while concatenation may appear to refer to a single
   type of combiner, there are in fact several possible artifact
   locations depending on implementation choices.  Artifacts help to
   support detection in the case of stripping attacks, which means that
   different artifact locations imply different overall system
   implementation considerations to be able to achieve such detection.

   Option case 1 provides the weakest guarantees of hybrid
   identification, as there are no prescribed artifacts and therefore
   non-separability is not achieved.  However, as can be seen, this does
   not generically imply that every implementation using concatenation
   fails to achieve non-separability.  Thus, it is advisable for
   implementors to provide transparency about artifact locations.

   In further observation, in option cases 2 and 5 the artifacts lie
   within the message.  This is notable as the authenticity of the
   message relies on the validity of the signature, and the artifact
   location means that the signature in turn relies on the authentic
   content of the message (the artifact label).  This creates a risk of
   circular dependency.  Alternative approaches such as option cases 3
   and 4 solve this circular dependancy by provisioning keys in a
   combined certificate.

   Another observation from this comparison is that artifact locations
   may be similar among some approaches.  For instance, option case 3
   and option case 6 both contain artifacts in the certificate.
   Naturally these examples are high-level and further specification on
   concrete schemes in the categories are needed before prescribing
   specific non-separability guarantees to each, but this does indicate
   how there could be a strong similarity between such guarantees.  Such
   comparisons all for a systematic decision process, where security is
   compared and identified and, if schemes are similar in the desired
   security goal, then decisions between schemes can be based on
   performance and implementation ease.

   A final observation that this type of comparison provides is how
   various combiners may change the security analysis assumptions in a
   system.  For instance, option cases 3, 4, 5, and 6 all push artifacts
   - and therefore the signature validity - into the certificate chain.
   Naturally the entire chain must then also use a similar combiner if a
   straightforward security argument is to be made.  Other options
   cases, such as 8, 9, 10, and 11 put artifacts within the signature
   itself, meaning that these bear the closest resimblance to
   tranditional schemes where message authenticity is dependent on
   signature validity.

4.  Need-For-Approval Spectrum

   In practice, use of hybrid digital signatures relies on standards
   specifications where applicable.  This is particularly relevant in
   the case of FIPS approval considerations as well as NIST, which has
   provided basic guidance on hybrid signature use.  NIST provides the
   following guidance (emphasis added),

      Assume that in a [hybrid] signature, _one signature is generated
      with a NIST-approved signature scheme as specified in FIPS 186,
      while another signature(s) can be generated using different
      schemes_, e.g., ones that are not currently specified in NIST
      standards..._hybrid signatures can be accommodated by current
      standards in FIPS mode, as defined in FIPS 140, provided at least
      one of the component methods is a properly implemented, NIST-
      approved signature algorithm_. For the purposes of FIPS 140
      validation, any signature that is generated by a non-approved
      component scheme would not be considered a security function,
      since the NIST-approved component is regarded as assuring the
      validity of the hybrid signature.  [NIST_PQC_FAQ]

   The emphasized texts point to two things: 1) the signature scheme for
   one of the component hybrids must be approved and 2) that said
   algorithm must be properly implemented.  This leaves some ambiguity
   as to whether only the algorithm must be approved and well
   implemented, or if that implementation must go through an approval
   process as well.  As such, there is a scale of approval that
   developers may consider as to whether they are using at least one
   approved component algorithm (1-out-of-n approved software module),
   or whether the implementation of that component algorithm has gone
   through an approvals review (thus making a all approved software
   module).  The former 1-out-of-n approved software module would
   suggest a straightforward path for FIPS-140 approvals based on the
   NIST guidelines; however, it is not inconceivable that using a all
   approved software module could automate much of the certification
   review and therefore be attractive to developers.

   We provide a scale for the different nuances of approval of the
   hybrid combiners.  This is related to whether the combiner needs a
   new approval process or falls under already approved specifications.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **New Algorithm**
| New signature scheme based on a selection of hardness assumptions
| Separate approval needed
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No Approved Software Module**
| Hybrid combiner supports security analysis that can be reduced to

| Uncertainty about whether separate approval is needed
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1-out-of-n Approved Software Module**
| Combiner supports one component algorithm and implementation  in a black-box way
| but potentially changes the other component algorithm implementation(s)
| No new approval needed if the black-box component (implementation) is approved
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **All Approved Software Modules**
| Hybrid combiner acts as a wrapper, fully independent of the component
| signature scheme implementations
| No new approval needed if at least one component implementation is approved
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

          Figure 2: Generality / Need-for-approval spectrum

   The first listed "combiner" would be a new construction with a
   security reduction to different hardness assumptions but not
   necessarily to approved (or even existing) signature schemes.  Such a
   new, singular algorithm relies on both traditional and nextgen
   principles.

   Next, is a combiner that might take inspiration from existing/
   approved signature schemes such that its security can be reduced to
   the security of the approved algorithms.  The combiner may, however,
   alter the implementations.  As such it is uncertain whether new
   approval would be needed as it might depend on the combiner and
   changes.  Such a case may potentially imply a distinction between a
   need for fresh approval of the algorithm(s) and approval of the
   implementation(s).

   The 1-out-of-n combiner uses at least one approved algorithm
   implementation in a black-box way.  It may potentially change the
   specifics of the other component algorithm implementations.  As long
   as at least one component is approved, no new approval is needed (per
   [NIST_PQC_FAQ]).

   In an All-Approved combiner, all algorithm implementations are used
   in a blackbox way.  A concatenation combiner is a simple example
   (where a signature is valid if all component signatures are valid).
   As long as at least one component is approved, no new approval is
   needed (per [NIST_PQC_FAQ]); thus as all algorithm implementations
   are approved the requirement is satisfied.

5.  EUF-CMA Challenges

   Under traditional signature scheme security assumptions such as EUF-
   CMA, the adversary 'wins' the security experiment if it can produce a
   new message such that a message-signature pair (m, sig) with it
   correctly verifies.  This traditional security notion is challenged
   under a hybrid construct.

   The most straightforward comparison would be for the adversary to
   attempt to produce a new message m' that a message-hybrid signature
   pair (m', sig_h) correctly verifies.  However, such a guarantee
   depends on the signature being strongly non-separable.  Otherwise, in
   practical terms a security experiment must capture the case that an
   existing or new message m could be verified with a component
   signature, e.g., to produce (m', sig_1) that correctly verifies under
   Sigma_1.Sign.  Such considerations are beyond the scope of
   traditional security analysis and represent considerations that would
   need to be accounted for depending on the signature combiner method
   chosen.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses digital signature constructions that may be
   used in security protocols.  It is an informational document and does
   not directly affect any other Internet draft.  The security
   considerations for any specific implementation or incorporation of a
   hybrid scheme should be discussed in the relevant specification
   documents.

7.  Discussion of Advantages/Disadvantages

   There is an inherent mutual exclusion between backwards compatibility
   and SNS.  While WNS allows for a valid separation under leftover
   artifacts, SNS will ensure verification failure if a receiver
   attempts separation.
