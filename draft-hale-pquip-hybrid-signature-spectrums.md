# Introduction {#introduction}

Initial focus on the transition to use of post-quantum algorithms in protocols
has largely been on confidentiality, given the potential risk of store and
decrypt attacks, where data encrypted today using traditional algorithms could
be decrypted in the future by an attacker with a Cryptographically-Relevant
Quantum Computer (CRQC). While traditional authentication is only at risk once a
CRQC exists, it is important to consider the transition to post-quantum
authentication before this point.  This is particularly relevant for systems
where algorithm turn-over is complex or takes a long time (e.g., long-lived
systems with hardware roots of trust), or where future checks on past
authenticity play a role (e.g., digital signatures on legal documents).

One approach to design quantum-resistant protocols, particularly during the
transition period from traditional to post-quantum algorithms, is incorporating
hybrid/composite signatures schemes, which combine both traditional and
post-quantum (or more generally next-generation) algorithms in one cryptographic
scheme. Hybridization has been looked at for key encapsulation [HYBRIDKEM], and
in an initial sense for digital signatures [HYBRIDSIG]. Compared to key
encapsulation, hybridization of digital signatures, where the verification tag
may be expected to attest to both standard and post-quantum components, is
subtler to design and implement due to the potential separability of the
composite signatures and the risk of downgrade/stripping attacks.  There are
also a range of requirements and properties that may be required from dual
signatures, not all of which can be achieved at once.

This document focuses on explaining advantages and disadvantages of different
hybrid signature scheme designs and different security goals for them. It is
intended as a resource for designers and implementers of hybrid signature
schemes to help them decide what properties they do and do not require from
their scheme.  It intentionally does not propose concrete hybrid signature
combiners or instantiations thereof.

## Terminology {#terminology}

We follow existing Internet drafts on hybrid terminology
[I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology] and hybrid key encapsulation mechanisms
(KEM) [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design] to enable settling on a consistent
language. We will make clear when this is not possible. In particular, we follow
the definition of 'post-quantum algorithm', 'traditional algorithms', and
'combiner'. Moreover, we use the definition of 'certificate' to mean 'public-key
certificate' as defined in [RFC4949].

- Signature scheme: A signature scheme is defined via the following three algorithms:
  - `KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)`: A probabilistic key generation algorithm, which
    generates a public verifying key `pk` and a secret signing key `sk`.
  - `Sign(sk, m) -> (sig)`: A probabilistic signature generation, which takes as
    input a secret signing key `sk` and a message `m`, and outputs a signature `sig`.
  - `Verify(pk, sig, m) -> b`: A verification algorithm, which takes as input a
    public verifying key `pk`, a signature `sig` and a message `m`, and outputs
    a bit `b` indicating `accept (b=1)` or `reject (b=0)` of the signature
    for message `m`.

- Hybrid signature scheme: Following [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology], we
  define a hybrid signature scheme to be "a multi-algorithm digital signature
  scheme made up of two or more component digital signature algorithms ...". While it often makes sense for security purposes to 
  require that the security of the component schemes is based on the hardness of
  different cryptographic assumptions, in other cases hybrid schemes might be motived, e.g., by interoperatbility of variants on the same scheme and as such both component schemes are based on the same hardness assumption. We allow this explicitely. This means in particular that in contrast to
  [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology], we will use the more general term
  'hybrid signature scheme' instead of requiring one post-quantum and one
  traditional algorithm (i.e., PQ/T hybrid signature schemes) to allow also the
  combination of several post-quantum algorithms. The term 'composite' scheme is
  often used as a synonym for 'hybrid scheme'. This is different from
  [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology] where the term is used at the protocol
  level.

- Hybrid signature: A hybrid signature is the output of the hybrid signature
  scheme's signature generation. As synonyms we might use 'composite signature'
  or 'dual signature'.  For example, NIST define a dual signature as "two or
  more signatures on a common message" [NIST_PQC_FAQ].

- Component (signature) scheme: Component signature schemes are the
  cryptographic algorithms contributing to the hybrid signature scheme. This has
  a similar purpose as in [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology].  In this
  draft, we will use 'ingredient signature scheme' as a synonym.

- Next-generation algorithms: Similarly to the case of hybrid KEMs
  [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], hybrid signatures are mostly motiviated as
  preparation for the post-quantum migration. Following
  [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], we opt to use the more generic term
  "next-generation" and "traditional" algorithm instead of "post-quantum" and
  "classical" algorithms.

- Artifact: An artifact is evidence of the sender's intent to hybridize a
  signature that remains even if a component algorithm tag is removed. Artifacts
  can be e.g., at the algorithmic level (e.g., within the digital signature), or
  at the protocol level (e.g., within the certificate), or on the system policy
  level (e.g., within the message). Artifacts should be easily identifiable by
  the receiver in the case of signature stripping.


## Motivation for use of hybrid signature schemes {#motivation}

Before diving into the design goals for hybrid digital signatures, it is worth
taking a look at why hybrid digital signatures are desirable for some
applications. As many of the arguments hold in general for hybrid algorithms, we
again refer to [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design] that summarizes these well.  In
addition, we explicate the motivation for hybrid signatures here.

### **Complexity**

Next-generation algorithms and their underlying hardness assumptions are often
more complex than traditional algorithms and as such carry a higher risk of
implementation mistakes and revision of parameters compared to traditional
algorithms, such as RSA. RSA is a relatively simple algorithm to understand and
explain, yet during its existence and use there have been multiple attacks and
refinements, such as adding requirements to how padding and keys are chosen, and
implementation issues such as cross-protocol attacks. Thus, even in a relatively
simple algorithm subtleties and caveats on implementation and use can arise over
time. Given the complexity of next generation algorithms, the chance of such
discoveries and caveats needs to be taken into account.

Of note, next generation algorithms have been heavily vetted. Thus, if and when
further information on caveats and implementation issues come to light, it is
less likely that a "break" will be catastrophic. Instead, such vulnerabilities
and issues may represent a weakening of security - which may in turn be offset
if a hybrid approach has been used. The complexity of next-generation algorithms
needs to be balanced against the fact that hybridization itself adds more
complexity to a protocol and introduces the risk of implementation mistakes in
the hybridization process.

One example of a next generation algorithm is the signature scheme ML-DSA
(a.k.a. CRYSTALS-Dilithium) that has been selected for standardization by
NIST. While the scheme follows the well-known Fiat-Shamir transform to construct the
signature scheme, it also relies on rejection sampling that is known to give
cache side channel information (although this does not lead to a known attack).
Furthermore, recent attacks again the next-generation multivariate schemes Rainbow
and GeMSS might call into question the asymptotic and concrete security for
conservative adopters and therefore might hinder adoption.

### **Time**

The need to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms now while simultaneously
being aware of potential, hidden subtleties in their resistance to standard
attacks drives transition designs towards hybridization.  Mosca’s equation
[MOSCA] very simply illustrates the risk of post-quantum transition delay: `l +
d > q`, where l is the information life-span, d is the time for system
transition to post-quantum algorithms, and q is the time before a quantum
computer is ready to execute cryptanalysis. As opposed to key exchange and KEMs,
it may not be obvious why there is urgency for an adoption of next-generation
signatures; namely, while encryption is subject to store-now-decrypt-later
attacks, there may not seem to be a parallel notion for authenticity, i.e.,
'store-now-modify-later attacks'.

However, in larger systems, including national systems, space systems, large
healthcare support systems, and critical infrastructure, where acquisition and
procurement time can be measured in years and algorithm replacement may be
difficult or even practically impossible, this equation can have drastic
implications.  In such systems, algorithm turn-over can be complex and difficult
and can take considerable time (such as in long-lived systems with hardware
deployment), meaning that an algorithm may be committed to long-term, with no
option for replacement. Long-term committment creates further urgency for
immediate next-generation algorithm selection.  Additionally, for some sectors
future checks on past authenticity plays a role (e.g., many legal, financial,
auditing, and governmental systems).  The 'store-now-modify-later' analogy would
present challenges in such sectors, where future analysis of past authentication
may be more critical than in e.g., internet connection use cases. As such there
is an eagerness to use next-generation signatures algorithms for some
applications.


## Goals {#goals}

There are various security goals that can be achieved through hybridization. The
following provides a summary of these goals, while also noting where security
goals are in conflict, i.e., that achievement of one goal precludes another,
such as backwards compatibility.

### **Unforgeability**

One goal is security of hybrid signature schemes, in particular that EUF-CMA
security is maintained as long as at least one of the ingredient schemes is
EUF-CMA secure.  There might be, however, other goals in competition with this
one, such as backward-compatibility, where the EUF-CMA security of the hybrid
signature relies solely on the security of one of the ingredient schemes instead
of relying on both.

### **Proof Composability**

Under proof composability, the ingredient algorithms are combined in such a way
that it is possible to prove a security reduction from the security properties
of hybrid signature scheme to the properties of the respective ingredient
signature schemes and, potentially, other building blocks such as hash
functions, KDF, etc.  Otherwise an entirely new proof of security is required,
and there is a lack of assurance that the combination builds on the
standardization processes and analysis performed to date on ingredient
algorithms. The resulting hybrid signature would be, in effect, an entirely new
algorithm of its own. The more the ingredient signature schemes are entangled,
the more likely it is that an entirely new proof is required, thus not meeting
proof composability.

### **Weak Non-Separability**

Non-Separability was one of the earliest properties of hybrid digital signatures
to be discussed [HYBRIDSIG]. It was defined as the guarantee that an adversary
cannot simply “remove” one of the ingredient signatures without evidence left
behind. For example there are artifacts that a carefully designed verifier may
be able to identify, or that are identifiable in later audits. This was later
termed Weak Non-Separability (WNS) [HYBRIDSIGDESIGN]. Note that WNS does not
restrict an adversary from potentially creating a valid ingredient digital
signature from a hybrid one (a signature stripping attack), but rather implies
that such a digital signature will contain artifacts of the separation. Thus
authentication is not simply provided by the sender to the receiver through
correct verification of the digital signature(s), but potentially through
further investigation on the receiver side that may extend well beyond
traditional signature verification behavior. For instance, this can intuitively
be seen in cases of a message containing a context note on hybrid
authentication, that is then signed by all ingredient algorithms/the hybrid
signature scheme. If an adversary removes one ingredient signature but not the
other, then artifacts in the message itself point to the possible existence of
hybrid signature such as a label stating “this message must be hybrid
signed”. This might be a counter measure against stripping attacks if the
verifier expects a hybrid signature scheme to have this property. However, it
places the responsibility of signature validity not only on the correct format
of the message, as in a traditional signature security guarantee, but the
precise content thereof.

### **Strong Non-Separability**

Strong Non-Separability (SNS) is a stronger notion of WNS, introduced in
[HYBRIDSIGDESIGN]. SNS guarantees that an adversary cannot take as input a
hybrid signature (and message) and output a valid ingredient signature (and
potentially different message) that will verify correctly. In other words,
separation of the hybrid signature into component signatures implies that the
component signature will fail verification (of the component signature scheme)
entirely. Therefore, authentication is provided by the sender to the receiver
through correct verification of the digital signature(s), as in traditional
signature security experiments. It is not dependent on other components, such as
message content checking, or protocol level aspects, such as public key
provenance. As an illustrative example distinguishing WNS from SNS, consider the
case of ingredient algorithms `Sigma_1.Sign` and `Sigma_2.Sign` where the
hybrid signature is computed as a concatenation `(sig_1, sig_2)`, where `sig_1 =
Sigma_1.Sign(hybridAlgID, m)` and `sig_2 = Sigma_2.Sign(hybridAlgID, m)`.  In
this case, a new message `m' = (hybridAlgID, m)`
along with signature `sig_1` and `Sigma_1.pk`, with the hybrid artifact embedded
in the message instead of the signature, could be correctly verified. The
separation would be identifiable through further investigation but the signature
verification itself would not fail. Thus, this case shows WNS (assuming the
verification algorithm is defined accordingly) but not SNS.

Some work [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs] has looked at reliance on the public
key certificate chains to explicitly define hybrid use of the public
key. Namely, that `Sigma_1.pk` cannot be used without `Sigma_2.pk`. This
implies pushing the hybrid artifacts into the protocol and system level and a
dependency on the security of other verification algorithms (namely those in the
certificate chain). This further requires that security analysis of a hybrid
digital signature requires analysis of the key provenance, i.e., not simply that
a valid public key is used but how its hybridization and hybrid artifacts have
been managed throughout the entire chain. External dependencies such as this may
imply hybrid artifacts lie outside the scope of the signature algorithm
itself. SNS may potentially be achieveable based on dependencies at the system
level.

<!--
However, since those
artifacts are outside the security definition scope for a digital
signature, namely definitions such EUF-CMA, we do not include them
in the SNS category.
-->

### **Backwards/Forwards Compatibility**

Backwards compatibility refers to the property where a hybrid signature may be
verified by only verifying one component signature, allowing the scheme to be
used by legacy receivers. In general this means verifying the traditional
component signature scheme, potentially ignoring the next-generation signature
entirely. This provides an option to transition sender systems to
next-generation algorithms while still supporting select legacy
receivers. Notably, this is a verification property; the sender has provided a
hybrid digital signature, but the verifier is allowed, due to internal policy
and/or implementation, to only verify one component signature. Backwards
compatibility may be further decomposed to subcategories where ingredient key
provenance is either separate or hybrid so as to support implementations that
cannot recognize (and/or process) hybrid signatures or keys.

Forwards compatibility has also been a consideration in hybrid proposals
[I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth]. Forward compatibility assumes
that hybrid signature schemes will be used for some time, but that eventually
all systems will transition to use only one (particularly, only one
next-generation) algorithm. As this is very similar to backwards compatibility,
it also may imply separability of a hybrid algorithm; however, it could also
simply imply capability to support separate component signatures. Thus the key
distinction between backwards and forwards compatibility is that backwards
compatibility may be needed for legacy systems that cannot use and/or process
hybrid or next-generation signatures, whereas in forwards compatibility the
system has those capabilities and can choose what to support (e.g., for
efficiency reasons).

As noted in [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], ideally, forward/backward
compatibility is achieved using redundant information as little as possible.

### **Simultaneous Verification**

Simultaneous Verification (SV) builds on SNS and was first introduced in
[HYBRIDSIGDESIGN]. SV requires that not only are all ingredient signatures
needed to achieve a successful verification present in the hybrid signature, but
also that verification of both component algorithms occurs
simultaneously. Namely, "missing" information needs to be computed by the
verifier so they cannot “quit” the verification process before both component
signatures are verified. SV mimics traditional digital signatures guarantees,
essentially ensuring that the hybrid digital signature behaves as a single
algorithm vs. two separate component stages. Alternatively phrased, under an SV
guarantee it is not possible for an unerring verifier to initiate termination of
the hybrid verification upon successful verification of one component algorithm
without also knowing if the other component succeeded or failed.

<!--

What the sender is assured of is that one of two cases occurred: either 1) the
receiver ignored the digital signatures or 2) the receiver initiated
verification of the digital signatures (resulting in either successful or failed
verification). WNS complicates this situation, resulting in six cases instead of
two: 1) the receiver ignored the digital signatures, 2) the receiver verified
the full hybrid combination (with success or failure); 3) the receiver initiated
verification of the hybrid digital signatures, but terminated once the standard
component succeeded or failed; 4) the receiver initiated verification of the
hybrid digital signatures, but terminated once the post-quantum component
succeeded or failed; 5) the receiver initiated verification of the standard
signature only (with success or failure), and 6) the receiver initiated
verification of the post-quantum signature only (with success or failure). It
may initially appear that (3) and (5) (resp. (4) and (6)) are similar, however
(3) and (4) are precisely the cases eliminated by SNS, i.e. that the verifier
does not take as input the hybrid digital signatures, instead only attempting
verification on one component. SNS thus improves the situation to only four
options. Still, the verifier can still terminate upon correctly checking only
one component signature without actually verifying both parts. One could argue
that a receiver who has checked the accuracy of their implementation should be
assured that both components are verifying.  This misconstrues the original
intent though, which is to correctly mirror traditional digital signatures
properties in hybrid digital signatures; ideally, the sender should be assured
that there are only two options: 1) ignore the digital signatures or 2) verify
the digital signatures (resulting in either failure or full
verification). Simultaneous Verification addresses this property.

-->

### **Hybrid Generality**

Hybrid generality means that a general signature combiner is defined, based on
inherent and common structures of component digital signatures "categories." For
instance, since multiple signature schemes use a Fiat-Shamir Transform, a hybrid
scheme based on the transform can be made that is generalizable to all such
signatures. Such generality can also result in simplified constructions whereas
more tailored hybrid variants might be more efficient in terms of sizes and
performance.

### **High performance**

Similarly to performance goals noted for hybridization of other cryptographic
components [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design] hybrid signature constructions are
expected to be as performant as possible. For most hybrid signatures this means
that the computation time should only minimally exceed the sum of the component
signature computation time. It is noted that performance of any variety may come
at the cost of other properties, such as hybrid generality.

### **High space efficiency**

Similarly to space considerations in [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], hybrid
signature constructions are expected to be as space performant as possible. This
includes messages (as they might increase if artifacts are used), public keys,
and the hybrid signature.  For the hybrid signature, size should no more than
minimally exceed the signature size of the two component signatures. In some
cases, it may be possible for a hybrid signature to be smaller than the
concatenationation of the two component signatures.

### **Minimal duplicate information**

Similarly to [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], duplicated information should be
avoided when possible. This might concern repeated information in hybrid
certificates or in the communication of component certificates in additional to
hybrid certificates (for example to achieve backwards/forwards-compatibility), or
sending multiple public keys or signatures of the same component algorithm.


# Non-separability spectrum

Non-separability is not a singular definition but rather is a scale,
representing `degrees` of separability hardness, visualized in
{{fig-spectrum-non-separability}}.

~~~

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
▼

{: #fig-spectrum-non-separability title="Spectrum of non-separability from weakest to strongest."}


At one end of the spectrum are schemes in which one of the ingredient signatures
can be stripped away with the verifier not being able to detect the change
during verification. An example of this includes simple concatenation of
signatures without any artifacts used. Nested signatures (where a message is
signed by one component algorithm and then the message-signature combination is
signed by the second component algorithm) may also fall into this category,
dependent on whether the inner or outer signature is stripped off without any
artifacts remaining.

Next on the spectrum are weakly non-separable signatures. Under Weak
Non-Separability, if one of the composite signatures of a hybrid is removed
artifacts of the hybrid will remain (in the message, signature, or at the
protocol level, etc.). This may enable the verifier to detect if a component
signature is stripped away from a hybrid signature, but that detectability
depends highly on the type of artifact and permissions.  For instance, if a
message contains a label artifact "This message must be signed with a hybrid
signature" then the system must be allowed to analyze the message contents for
possible artifacts. Whether a hybrid signature offers (Weak/Strong)
Non-Separability might also depend on the implementation and policy of the
protocol or application the hybrid signature is used in on the verifier
side. Such policies may be further ambiguous to the sender, meaning that the
type of authenticity offered to the receiver is unclear.  In another example,
under nested signatures the verifier could be tricked into interpreting a new
message as the message/inner signature combination and verify only the outer
signature.  In this case, the inner signature-tag is an artifact.

Third on the scale is the Strong Non-Separability notion, in which separability
detection is dependent on artifacts in the signature itself. Unlike in Weak
Non-Separability, where artifacts may be in the actual message, the certificate,
or in other non-signature components, this notion more closely ties to
traditional algorithm security notions (such as EUF-CMA) where security is
dependent on the internal construct of the signature algorithm and its
verification. In this type, the verifier can detect artifacts on an
algorithmic level during verification. For example, the signature itself may encode
the information that a hybrid signature scheme is used. Examples of this type
may be found in [HYBRIDSIGDESIGN].

, assuming a "loose" verification implementation where the
verifier may skill a final bit comparison check.
-->

For schemes achieving the most demanding security notion, Strong
Non-Separability with Simultaneous Verification, verification succeeds not only
when both of the component signatures are present but also only when the
verifier has verified both signatures. Moreover, no information is leaked to the
receiver during the verification process on the possibile validity/invalidity of
the component signatures until both verify. This construct most closely mirrors
traditional digital signatures where, assuming that the verifier does verify a
signature at all, the result is either a positive verification of a the full
signature or a failure if the signature is not valid. For hybrid signatures, a
`full signature` implies the hybridization of both component algorithms, and
therefore the strongest non-separability notion enforces an all-or-nothing
approach to verification. Examples of algorithms providing this type of security
can be found in [HYBRIDSIGDESIGN].

on discussing the concrete algorithms.

# Artifacts {#artspectrum}

Hybridization benefits from the presence of artifacts as evidence of the
sender's intent to decrease the risk of successful stripping attacks. This,
however, depends strongly on where such evidence resides (e.g., in the message,
the signature, or somewhere on the protocol level instead of at the algorithmic
level). Even commonly discussed hybrid approaches, such as concatenation, are
not inherently tied to one type of security (e.g., WNS or SNS). This can lead to
ambiguities when comparing different approaches and assumptions about
security or lack thereof. Thus in this section we cover artifact locations and
also walk through a high-level comparison of a few hybrid categories to
show how artifact location can differ within a given approach.  Artifact
location is tied to non-separability notions above; thus the selection of a
given security guarantee and general hybrid approach must also include finer
grained selection of artifact placement.

<!--

In this section we exemplify the difference in non-separability guarantees
depending on the artifact location for three types of hybridization, namely
concatenation, nesting, and 'fused' hybrid explained next.

-->

<!--

While the above discussion about the non-separability spectrum covers a spectrum
of security guarantees and existence of artifacts are linked to achieving those,
this (sub-)section covers some specific examples of artifact placement.

-->


## Artifact locations

There are a variety of artifact locations possible, ranging from within the
message to the signature algorithm to the protocol level and even into policy,
as shown in {{tab-artifact-location}}.  For example, one artifact location could
be in the message to be signed, e.g., containing a label artifact.  Depending on
the hybrid type, it might be possible to strip this away. For example, a quantum
attacker could strip away the quantum-secure signature of a concatenated dual
signature, and (being able to forge, e.g., ECDSA signatures) remove the label
artifact from the message as well. So, for many applications and threat models,
adding an artificat in the message might not prevent stripping attacks.  Another
artifact location could be in the public key certificates as described in
[I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs]. In yet another case, artifacts may be
present through the fused hybrid method, thus making them part of the signature
at the algorithmic level.

Eventual security analysis may be a consideration in choosing between
levels. For example, if the security of the hybrid scheme is dependent on system
policy, then cryptographic analysis must necessarily be reliant on specific
policies and it may not be possible to describe a scheme's security in a
standalone sense.

## Artifact Location Comparison Example {#artspectrumexample}

Here we provide a high-level example of how artifacts can appear in different
locations even within a single, common approach. We look at the following
categories of approaches: concatenation, nesting, and fusion.  This is to
illustrate that a given approach does not inherently imply a specific
non-separability notion and that there are subtleties to the selection decision,
since hybrid artifacts are related to non-separability guarantees.
Additionally, this comparison highlights how artifacts placement can be
identical in two different hybrid approaches.

We briefly summarize the hybrid approach categories (concatenation, nesting, and
fusion) for clarity in description, before showing how each one may have
artifacts in different locations in {{tab-hybrid-approach-categories}}.

- Concatenation: variants of hybridization where, for component algorithms
`Sigma_1.Sign` and `Sigma_2.Sign`, the hybrid signature is calculated as a
concatenation `(sig_1, sig_2)` such that `sig_1 = Sigma_1.Sign(hybridAlgID, m)`
and `sig_2 = Sigma_2.Sign(hybridAlgID, m)`.

<!--

WNS may be a goal of a concatenation approach.  NB: I took it out because I
don't see a reason why there shouldn't been a policy or protocol artificat
making concatenation SNS.

-->

- Nesting: variants of hybridization where for component algorithms
`Sigma_1.Sign` and `Sigma_2.Sign`, the hybrid signature is calculated in a
layered approach as `(sig_1, sig_2)` such that, e.g., `sig_1 =
Sigma_1.Sign(hybridAlgID, m)` and
`sig_2 = Sigma_2.Sign(hybridAlgID, (m, sig_1))`.

<!--

WNS and potentially SNS (depending on prediction that $sig_1$ would be targeted
in a stripping attack) may be goals of a nesting approach.

-->

- Fused hybrid: variants of hybridization where for component algorithms
`Sigma_1.Sign` and `Sigma_2.Sign`, the hybrid signature is calculated with
entanglement to produce a single hybrid signature `sig_h` without clear
component constructs.

<!--

SNS and potentially SV are goals of a true hybrid approach.

{: #tab-hybrid-approach-categories title="Artifact locations depending on the hybrid signature type"}


As can be seen, while concatenation may appear to refer to a single type of
combiner, there are in fact several possible artifact locations depending on
implementation choices. Artifacts help to support detection in the case of
stripping attacks, which means that different artifact locations imply different
overall system implementation considerations to be able to achieve such
detection.

Case 1 provides the weakest guarantees of hybrid identification, as there
are no prescribed artifacts and therefore non-separability is not achieved.
However, as can be seen, this does not imply that every
implementation using concatenation fails to achieve non-separability. Thus, it
is advisable for implementors to be transparent about artifact locations.

In cases 2 and 5 the artifacts lie within the
message. This is notable as the authenticity of the message relies on the
validity of the signature, and the artifact location means that the signature in
turn relies on the authentic content of the message (the artifact label). This
creates a risk of circular dependency. Alternative approaches such as
cases 3 and 4 solve this circular dependency by provisioning keys in a combined
certificate.

Another observation from this comparison is that artifact locations may be
similar among some approaches. For instance, case 3 and case 6 both contain
artifacts in the certificate. Naturally these examples are high-level and
further specification on concrete schemes in the categories are needed before
prescribing non-separability guarantees to each, but this does indicate how
there could be a strong similarity between such guarantees.  Such comparisons
allow for a systematic decision process, where security is compared and
identified and, if schemes are similar in the desired security goal, then
decisions between schemes can be based on performance and implementation ease.

A final observation that this type of comparison provides is how various
combiners may change the security analysis assumptions in a system. For
instance, cases 3, 4, 5, and 6 all push artifacts - and therefore the
signature validity - into the certificate chain. Naturally the entire chain must
then also use a similar combiner if a straightforward security argument is to be
made. Other cases, such as 8, 9, 10, and 11 put artifacts within the
signature itself, meaning that these bear the closest resemblance to
traditional schemes where message authenticity is dependent on signature
validity.

<!--

The artifact placements in nesting combiners may be surprisingly similar to
those in concatenation option cases 2, 3, and 4. Namely, if `sig_2 =
Sigma_2.Sign(hybridAlgID, (m, sig_1))`, then the "message" `(m, sig_1)` input
into `Sigma_2.Sign` actually contains the artifact and acts as a label.  Unless
an additional label is provided within $m$ itself, $sig_1$ does not therefore
contain an artifact. Where the artifact is located is necessarily dependent upon
the threat model; guessing which algorithm is more at risk from a stripping
attack and choosing the order of nesting accordingly may change the location of
an artifact.

Under a fused combiner, artifacts of hybridization are present within the
signature. This can be coupled with artifacts in the message, such as through
use of a label, and/or artifacts in the certificate if keys are also provisioned
in a combined certificate.

# Need-For-Approval Spectrum

In practice, use of hybrid digital signatures relies on standards specifications
where applicable. This is particularly relevant in the case of FIPS approval
considerations as well as NIST, which has provided basic guidance on hybrid
signature use. NIST provides the following guidance (emphasis added),

> Assume that in a \[hybrid\] signature, *one signature is
> generated with a NIST-approved signature scheme as specified
> in FIPS 186, while another signature(s) can be generated using
> different schemes*, e.g., ones that are not currently specified
> in NIST standards...*`hybrid signatures` can be accommodated by
> current standards in ``FIPS mode,`` as defined in FIPS 140,
> provided at least one of the component methods is a properly
> implemented, NIST-approved signature algorithm*. For the purposes
> of FIPS 140 validation, any signature that is generated by a
> non-approved component scheme would not be considered a security
> function, since the NIST-approved component is regarded as
> assuring the validity of the `hybrid` signature. [NIST_PQC_FAQ]

The emphasized texts point to two things: 1) the signature scheme for one of the
component algorithms must be approved and 2) that said algorithm must be properly
implemented. This leaves some ambiguity as to whether only the algorithm must be
approved and well implemented, or if that implementation must go through an
approval process as well.  As such, there is a ``scale of approval`` that
developers may consider as to whether they are using at least one approved
component algorithm (``1-out-of-n approved software module``), or whether the
implementation of that component algorithm has gone through an approvals review
(thus making a ``all approved software module``). The former ``1-out-of-n
approved software module`` would suggest a straightforward path for FIPS-140
approvals based on the NIST guidelines; however, it is not inconceivable that
using a ``all approved software module`` could automate much of the
certification review and therefore be attractive to developers.

We provide a scale for the different nuances of approval of the hybrid
combiners. This is related to whether the combiner needs a new approval process
or falls under already approved specifications.

{: #fig-generality-spectrum title="Generality / Need-for-approval spectrum"}

The first listed "combiner" would be a new construction with a security
reduction to different hardness assumptions but not necessarily to approved (or
even existing) signature schemes. Such a new, singular algorithm relies on both
traditional and nextgen principles.

Next, is a combiner that might take inspiration from existing/approved signature
schemes such that its security can be reduced to the security of the approved
algorithms. The combiner may, however, alter the implementations.  As such it is
uncertain whether new approval would be needed as it might depend on the
combiner and changes. Such a case may potentially imply a distinction between a
need for fresh approval of the algorithm(s) and approval of the
implementation(s).

The 1-out-of-n combiner uses at least one approved algorithm implementation in a
black-box way. It may potentially change the specifics of the other component
algorithm implementations. As long as at least one component is approved, no new
approval is needed (per [NIST_PQC_FAQ]).

In an All-Approved combiner, all algorithm implementations are used in a
blackbox way. A concatenation combiner is a simple example (where a signature is
valid if all component signatures are valid).  As long as at least one component
is approved, no new approval is needed (per [NIST_PQC_FAQ]); thus as all
algorithm implementations are approved the requirement is satisfied.

# EUF-CMA Challenges

Under traditional signature scheme security assumptions such as EUF-CMA, the
adversary 'wins' the security experiment if it can produce a new message such
that a message-signature pair `(m, sig)` with it correctly verifies. This
traditional security notion is challenged under a hybrid construct.

The most straightforward comparison would be for the adversary to attempt to
produce a new message `m'` that a message-hybrid signature pair `(m', sig_h)`
correctly verifies.  However, such a guarantee depends on the signature being
strongly non-separable. Otherwise, in practical terms a security experiment must
capture the case that an existing or new message `m` could be verified with a
component signature, e.g., to produce `(m', sig_1)` that correctly verifies
under `Sigma_1.Sign`. Such considerations are beyond the scope of traditional
security analysis and represent considerations that would need to be accounted
for depending on the signature combiner method chosen.


# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

This document discusses digital signature constructions that may be used in
security protocols. It is an informational document and does not directly affect
any other Internet draft. The security considerations for any specific
implementation or incorporation of a hybrid scheme should be discussed in the
relevant specification documents.


# Discussion of Advantages/Disadvantages

There is an inherent mutual exclusion between backwards compatibility and SNS.
While WNS allows for a valid separation under leftover artifacts, SNS will
ensure verification failure if a receiver attempts separation.
